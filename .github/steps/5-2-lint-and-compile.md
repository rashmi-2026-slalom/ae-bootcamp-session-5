# Step 5-2: Lint and Compile Error Resolution

## Goal

Systematically resolve ESLint errors and warnings using your `code-reviewer` agent. Work through compilation/linting feedback loops, fixing issues one category at a time.

## Background

Now that your tests pass, it's time to ensure code quality. The codebase has ESLint configured with rules that catch common mistakes, unused code, and style violations. Your goal is to achieve zero lint errors across both frontend and backend.

UI tests are a required part of the overall approach, and this step prepares for that by ensuring the codebase is clean and stable before UI automation is executed.

> **Continuing from Step 5-1**: You're still on the `feature/agentic-workflow` branch. Let's use your `code-reviewer` agent to systematically clean up the code!

### :keyboard: Activity: Verify Lint Errors Exist

Before fixing, let's confirm there are lint errors to address:

1. In terminal, run:

   ```bash
   cd packages/backend && npm run lint
   ```

2. You should see errors/warnings like:
   - `no-console` warnings for console.log statements
   - `no-unused-vars` errors for unused variables

**If you see NO lint errors**: This is unusual - they should exist from Step 5-1. Verify:

- You're on the correct branch (`feature/agentic-workflow`)
- Step 5-1 focused only on test fixes, not lint cleanup
- If lint was already fixed, that's okay - the scope boundary training still happened. Proceed to validate and move to Step 5-3.

**If you see lint errors**: Perfect! Let's fix them systematically. 👇

### :keyboard: Activity: Fix All Lint Errors

> 💡 **How `/execute-step` works**: It reads the instructions from this GitHub Issue comment, auto-switches to `code-reviewer` agent, and executes the lint fixes autonomously. The Issue content tells it what to do!

Use `/execute-step` to autonomously resolve all ESLint errors:

1. **Run** `/execute-step 5-2` in Copilot Chat

2. **Watch the AI work!** It will:
   - Auto-switch to `code-reviewer` agent
   - Run lint on backend (`packages/backend`)
   - Fix errors systematically by category (unused variables → console statements → style issues)
   - Verify tests still pass after fixes
   - Run lint on frontend (`packages/frontend`)
   - Fix frontend errors (unused imports, useEffect dependencies, console statements)
   - Run full workspace lint validation
   - Continue until zero lint errors

   **IMPORTANT - Scope Boundary**:
   This step focuses on lint and compile quality. The AI should:
   - ✅ Resolve lint and compile issues systematically
   - ✅ Verify tests continue to pass after fixes
   - ✅ Prepare code quality baseline for upcoming integration and UI test workflows
   - ❌ DO NOT start creating UI tests in this step (handled in later workflow steps)

3. **Review the changes** it made in both `packages/backend/src/app.js` and `packages/frontend/src/App.js`

> 💡 **What's happening?** The AI categorizes lint errors and fixes them systematically, verifying tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks. It automatically documents patterns to memory as it works!

### :keyboard: Activity: Validate and Progress

Now verify your work and push to trigger the next step:

1. **Validate completion** using `/validate-step`
   - Run: `/validate-step 5-2` in Copilot Chat
   - Checks that all lint errors are fixed
   - Verifies tests still pass

2. **Commit and push** using `/commit-and-push`
   - Run: `/commit-and-push` in Copilot Chat
   - Provide branch: `feature/agentic-workflow`
   - AI analyzes changes and creates commit message
   - Pushes to trigger Step 5-3 workflow automatically

## Success Criteria

To complete this exercise successfully:

- ✅ No ESLint errors in backend (`npm run lint` in packages/backend)
- ✅ No ESLint errors in frontend (`npm run lint` in packages/frontend)
- ✅ All tests still pass (`npm test` at root)
- ✅ Changes are committed and pushed to `feature/agentic-workflow` using `/commit-and-push`
- ✅ Lint-clean baseline is established for the next phase of integration and required UI testing workflows

## Key Workflow Patterns

✨ **Systematic Error Resolution**: Categorize and fix similar issues together for efficiency

✨ **Continuous Testing**: Verify tests still pass after each fix round

✨ **Code Quality Standards**: ESLint catches bugs and enforces consistent patterns

✨ **AI-Assisted Review**: Using `code-reviewer` agent to understand and systematically resolve quality issues

✨ **Workflow Automation**: Using `/validate-step` and `/commit-and-push` prompts to progress through steps

✨ **Phased Quality Strategy**: Complete lint/compile stabilization now so integration and required UI testing can run reliably in the next step
