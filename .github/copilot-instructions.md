# Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
- Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend.
- Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development.
- Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion.

## Documentation References
Use these documents to understand architecture, standards, and workflow expectations:
- [docs/project-overview.md](../docs/project-overview.md) - Architecture, tech stack, and structure.
- [docs/testing-guidelines.md](../docs/testing-guidelines.md) - Test patterns and standards.
- [docs/workflow-patterns.md](../docs/workflow-patterns.md) - Development workflow guidance.

## Development Principles
- Test-Driven Development: Follow Red-Green-Refactor for all new behavior.
- Incremental Changes: Make small, testable modifications that are easy to validate.
- Systematic Debugging: Use failing tests and error output to guide diagnosis.
- Validation Before Commit: Ensure all tests pass and linting reports no errors.

## Testing Scope
This project uses unit tests, integration tests, and UI end-to-end tests:
- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing.
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component unit/integration tests.
- UI testing: Playwright for critical user journey automation.
- Manual browser testing for exploratory validation and visual checks.
- Reason: Combine fast feedback (unit/integration) with end-to-end quality confidence (UI tests).

**Testing Approach by Context**
- Backend API changes: Write Jest tests FIRST, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR).
- Frontend component features: Write React Testing Library tests FIRST for component behavior, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Follow with manual browser testing for full UI flows.
- This is true TDD: Test first, then code to pass the test.

## Workflow Patterns
Follow these development workflows:
1. TDD Workflow: Write/fix tests -> Run -> Fail -> Implement -> Pass -> Refactor.
2. Code Quality Workflow: Run lint -> Categorize issues -> Fix systematically -> Re-validate.
3. Integration Workflow: Identify issue -> Debug -> Test -> Fix -> Verify end-to-end.
4. UI Testing Workflow: Define critical journeys -> Create UI tests -> Run -> Debug failures -> Validate coverage.

## Agent Usage
Use specialized agents based on the type of work:
- tdd-developer: For implementation and unit/integration TDD cycles; do NOT create or run Playwright UI tests in this mode.
- code-reviewer: For addressing lint errors and code quality improvements.
- test-engineer: Owns all Playwright UI test authoring/execution, failure triage, and isolation checks.

## Memory System
- Persistent Memory: This file (.github/copilot-instructions.md) contains foundational principles and workflows.
- Working Memory: .github/memory/ directory contains discoveries and patterns.
- During active development, take notes in .github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md (not committed).
- At end of session, summarize key findings into .github/memory/session-notes.md (committed).
- Document recurring code patterns in .github/memory/patterns-discovered.md (committed).
- Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions.

## Workflow Utilities
Use GitHub CLI commands for workflow automation (available to all modes):
- List open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
- Get issue details: `gh issue view <issue-number>`
- Get issue with comments: `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments`
- The main exercise issue will have "Exercise:" in the title.
- Steps are posted as comments on the main issue.
- Use these commands when `/execute-step` or `/validate-step` prompts are invoked.

## Git Workflow
Follow conventional commits and branch strategy guidelines:
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Feature branches: `feature/<descriptive-name>`.
- Always stage all changes before committing: `git add .`
- Push to the correct branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`.
